# Favourite Ruby API's are:

# Ruby-doc.org, when I want to look up the reference of available methods, etc.
# As I like the clean interface when searching for enteries. Will use this API often.

#BUT.... 

# Ruby-lang.org, I also like this for it's FAQ's, free 'fun' books, and the layout of
# their 'beginner-friendly', 'getting started' and FAQ's sections. I will consult this
# when I want to consume more curated content rather than simple enteries I'll be using 
# the first API for.

# What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
#It retuns value 3. Index method returns the index of the first
#instance that returns true to the argument(5). Five returns true
# at index 3.
2. arr.index[5]
#This delivers an error. Index method doesn't take a 
#location-style box as an argument=of-sorts.
3. arr[5]
# returns 8 as it locates a position in the array at index 5.

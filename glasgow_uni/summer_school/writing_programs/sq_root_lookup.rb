Use a dictionary as a lookup table to calculate and store the square roots of the first 100 positive integers.  
The math library contains the sqrt function â€“ the function call math.sqrt( 100 ) will return 10.0.  
Once the lookup table is created, then repeatedly ask the user for numbers between 1 and 100 and write out the square root of the number by using 
the lookup table you have created. Ensure the numbers entered by the user are in range.
